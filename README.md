# Backend Template in Rust

This is a template for a backend server written in Rust.

The idea is to have a simple and clean starting point for a backend server in Rust, where I can add my own features and libraries later on.

I'm planning to write this server with the following features:

1. REST Full API
2. Swagger Documentation from OpenAPI
3. Axum as the web framework
4. Possibility to use multiple databases (SQLite and PostgreSQL - starting with SQLite and adding PostgreSQL later)
5. JWT Authentication
6. Web UI built with Vue.js 3 and TypeScript
