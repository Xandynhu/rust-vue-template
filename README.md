# Backend Template in Rust

This is a template for a backend server written in Rust.

The idea is to have a simple and clean starting point for a backend server in Rust, where I can add my own features and libraries later on.

I'm planning to write this server with the following features:

1. REST Full API
2. Swagger Documentation from OpenAPI
3. Axum as the web framework
4. Possibility to use multiple databases (SQLite and PostgreSQL - starting with SQLite and adding PostgreSQL later)
5. JWT Authentication
6. Web UI nased on the SPA (Single Page Application) concept
7. Web UI will be written in another repository, and only built files will be placed here under /dist folder
